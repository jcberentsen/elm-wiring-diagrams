{-| To avoid brittle layout tests, we should strive to
test invariant aspects, like centers lining up, relative placement etc.

The tests should should be invariant to things that are likely to change in the future,
like defaults for paddings, widths, heights, spacings...

Also avoid having tests overlapping in ways that one change breaks multiple tests.
